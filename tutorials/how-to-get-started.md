# How to get started

This guide will teach you how to get started making mods for Geometry Dash (some of this information can be used to mod other games too)

## Prerequisites

### General GD/Cocos2d-x/Computer knowledge

Geometry Dash runs on a game engine called cocos2d-x (2.2.3) which is a cross platform game engine. Learning how to use cocos2d-x 2.2.3 will be benefical for creating good mods. You can find the documentation for cocos2d-x 2.2.3 [here](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/V2.2.3/). You also will need to know basic things on how a computer or game works.

### Knowledge of C++

To do any type of modding, you need a low level programming langauge to edit the memory like C++ or Rust. C++ is prefered to be used by many modders because GD is made in C++, but you can absolutly use Rust as well. This guide will not explain how to use Rust for GD modding.

### Visual Studio 2019

The prefered IDE for making Geometry Dash mods is Visual Studio 2019 as the mods will be more compatible with gd.

#### Installation

You can download Visual Studio 2019 [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
